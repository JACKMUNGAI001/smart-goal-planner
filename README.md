A single-page web application for managing multiple savings goals, tracking progress, and making deposits using a local JSON-based API.

## Description

Smart Goal Planner is a minimalist, interactive web app that allows users to create, manage, and track financial goals. Built with React and Vite, it uses a local json-server to simulate a REST API for full CRUD functionality. Users can add goals, make deposits, track progress with visual progress bars, and view an overview of their savings. The app demonstrates core React concepts, asynchronous API interaction with fetch, and responsive design.


## Features

- *Home Page*: Displays a welcome message, overview, and navigation for managing goals.
- *Goal Management*: Create, read, update, and delete financial goals (e.g., "Travel Fund," "Emergency Fund") using a local JSON-based API.
- *Progress Tracking*: Visual progress bars, saved amount, target amount, and remaining amount for each goal.
- *Deposits*: Add deposits to specific goals, updating their progress in real-time.
- *Overview*: Shows total goals, total saved amount, and number of completed goals.
- *Deadline Alerts*: Highlights goals due within 30 days ("Due Soon") or overdue ("Overdue").
- *Responsive Design*: Clean, user-friendly layout optimized for desktop and mobile.
